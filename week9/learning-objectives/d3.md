### Event Handling Objectives

Below is a complete list of the event handling objectives for this lesson.
When you complete this lesson, you should be able to perform each of the
following objectives. These objectives capture how you may be evaluated on the
assessment for this lesson.

- ### Be very familiar with these common event listeners: `click`, `submit`, `change`, and `DOMContentLoaded`

  ### - _Click_

  > The click event is triggered whenever the user clicks page. The click event is usually the main way users interact with elements on most web pages.

  ### - _Input_

  > The input event fires whenever the value of an HTML element changes. For example, an `<input type="text">` element has input events trigger whenever a user types on the element. This event is only available on elements that have the contenteditable property, such as `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>`.

  ### - _Change_

  > The change event is triggered on the same elements as the input event, but only fires when the user has committed the change. To understand the difference, the input event fires on each individual keystroke in `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements, but the change event will fire when the user clicks away from the input field.

  ### - _Submit_

  > The submit event is triggered whenever a `<form>` is submitted. This can happen when a submit `<button>` or `<input type="submit">` is clicked, or when the Enter key is pressed within the `<form>`. This event is typically used to handle the data from `<input>` fields within the `<form>`. This includes validation of the data, as well as sending the data to a server to handle.

  ### - _DOMContentLoaded_

  > The DOMContentLoaded event is somewhat different from all the previous events. The events above are all triggered when a used interacts with HTML elements on the page, but DOMContentLoaded fires when the initial HTML document has loaded, but before stylesheets, images, and other assets are done loading.

  > This event is particularly useful when you have JavaScript that needs to interact with the DOM but there are a lot assets on the page. Waiting for stylesheets, images, and other assets to load can take a long time and detract from the user experience of a web page so this event can be useful for performance.

- Research to discover and utilize a new event listener to accomplish a given task

---

- Add and/or remove an event listener from one or more HTML elements

  > Syntax to create an event listener: \
  > `Element.addEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction)`

  > _To remove the same event listener, the removeEventListener method is called and takes the **same arguments, event type, and the callback function**. These arguments are necessary to find the correct event listener to remove in case there are multiple events on a single element._

  > Syntax to remove an event listener: \
  > `Element.removeEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction)`

---

- Manipulate the DOM as a response to an event

  ```
  Example of a click event

  HTML:
  <button id="myButton"></button>

  Javascript:
  document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function(){ alert("Button clicked!"); });
  ```

- Predict and prevent the default behavior of an event
  > The Event.preventDefault() method stops the default action of an event.

---

- Add, remove, and read data on an HTML element

  > _Storing the data- attribute_: `Element.setAttribute` \
  > _Reading data- from elements_: `Element.dataset`\
  > _Deleting data- attributes_: `delete Element.dataset`
